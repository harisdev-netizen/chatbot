# CHATBOT
Python was used to build a straightforward chatbot that can converse with users and pick up new information through training.

Features#
In this activity, we will be using a Python library, chatterbot, to implement a chatbot.
This library generates automated responses to the user input. The responses are based on machine learning algorithms implemented in the library.
Our goal is to make sure that the chatbot is trained in multiple languages in order to cater to different communities.
The ML algorithms make it easier for the chatbot to improve and evolve its responses over time as it collects user responses.
These features make it easier for the chatbot to engage in conversations through different mobile apps and websites. It saves input data from the user and evolves over time. The accuracy of the chatbot response increases over time as it learns from the user.
